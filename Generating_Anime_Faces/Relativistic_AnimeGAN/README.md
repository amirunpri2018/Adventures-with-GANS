## AnimeGAN Architecture

Relativistic AnimeGAN is based on the concept of Relativistic Discriminator for a Deep Convolutional GAN proposed by Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau.

## Training Relativistic AnimeGAN

The Relativistic AnimeGAN was trained on 21551 anime face images from size `(64, 64)` and was trained for 300 epochs for a batch size of 32 images using Nvidia Tesla K80 GPU in the Kaggle Kernel environment.
